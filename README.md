Hello there,

Hope you are having a good day
This is a energy consumption prediction system.
Dataset used in this project belongs to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landauof/aep-hourly.

AEP_hourly.csv was actually a huge dataset and indeed a great dataset to predict the most accurate predictions.
But, I minimized the rows of this (AEP_hourly.csv) dataset because I want processing as fast as possible.
The minimization code is separately written in 'AEP_hourly_rearrangement.py'.
The original dataset used in project is 'Energy.csv'.

Thank You!
